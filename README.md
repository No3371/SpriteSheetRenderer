# SpriteSheetRenderer
This is a set of DOTS systems that allows about 100,0000 sprites be rendered on screen at about 100 FPS (on a good PC).

Forked from [fabriziospadaro/SpriteSheetRenderer](https://github.com/fabriziospadaro/SpriteSheetRenderer), refactored to match my coding and system architecture standard.

Animating not implemented.
